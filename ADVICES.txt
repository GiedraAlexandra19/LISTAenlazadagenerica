In class "ListaEnlazada.h" You should review the overload of 
operators necessary for its correct operation.
In the same way with the class "Iterator.h" I have observed 
that it is necessary to overload the access operators (*) and 
movement (++ p and p ++) for the correct functioning of the pattern.
Also your "fill_random ()" method seems useless to me since 
you work with templates and the generation of elements of that 
method reduces all your abstraction to working with integers.
I hope these tips can help you improve your developer skills.
